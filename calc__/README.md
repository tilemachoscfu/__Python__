Create an empty list and fill it with a random number (up to 50) of random values in the range (1 - 100).<br>
The numbers in the list need not be unique.<br>
Upon completion sort the list.<br>
Calculate and display the Mean, Median, Mode, and Range.<br>

<b>What is mean, median, mode and range</b> <br>
The "mean" is the "average" you're used to, where you add up all the numbers and then divide by the number of numbers. The "median" is the "middle" value in the list of numbers. To find the median, your numbers have to be listed in numerical order from smallest to largest, so you may have to rewrite your list before you can find the median. The "mode" is the value that occurs most often. If no number in the list is repeated, then there is no mode for the list.
